My research concerns the study of the factors involved in tree-ring formation in the boreal forest and how their variations affect the final tree-ring features. Based on different modeling approaches, I assess the influence of temporal dynamics on cell traits to test how much developmental and environmental factors affect the process of tree-ring formation. My expertise spreads from wood anatomy data extraction and manipulation, to data analysis and code vectorization for the analysis of big datasets. I am moderator of Utilisat’Rs, a technical assistance and knowledge-sharing weekly group for the use of the statistical software R
